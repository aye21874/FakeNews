Liar dataset is used for the fake news detection having 12,800 human labelled short statements in various contexts related to politics. The dataset is used as a fact-checking research and each statement is evaluated by the politifact.com editor for its truthfulness. Automatic fake news detection is a challenging problem in deception detection, and it has tremendous potential on real-world political and social impacts. 

The three questions out of this dataset which we are interested in pursuing are:

1) Do high positions of authority lead to misleading information?

2) Which method of communication or social media platforms are most prone to
misinformation?

3) The state’s with maximum proportions of fake news and in what subject? Which subject
has the most concentrated fake news?

Overall, through visualization, we wanted to find out the most reliable method of receiving correct information, which platforms we can pay attention to for controversial topics, and the suspicious figures we should avoid for getting correct information.
