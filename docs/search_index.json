Social Media platforms like Facebook and Twitter enables us to access news anywhere, but they also have the potential to spread misinformation. This has a negative impact on the society, thereby making it necessary to verify the accuracy of news. Automatic fake news detection is a challenging problem in deception detection, and it has tremendous potential on real-world political and social impacts. One of the datasets which allow us to build models and predict fake news is Liar Detection. This dataset has has 12,800 human labelled short statements in various contexts related to politics, and useful for the fact-checking research for news. In this project, we have used this dataset to explore the following questions/statements through exploratory data analysis. Questions/Statements 1) Which positions of authority lead to Fake &amp; Factual information? Which party tends to spread Fake News more? 2) What are the most selected Topics/Subjects selected by each Speaker which has the highest tendency of spreading Fake News? 3) Which states are spreading the most false news, also noting the number of different speakers involved in spreading Fake News? 4) Which method of communication has resulted in the most Fake News spread by state? 5) Correlations, Clusters &amp; Outliers observed for different Venues/Platforms in spreading Fake News for each State. 6) Count of Words in a Statement in relation with its Label. 7) What are the proportions of fake news for each state? 8) What are the states with maximum proportions of fake news and in what subject? 9) Distribution of Factual News with respect to state 10) Which subject has the most concentrated fake news? 11) Origin of Fake Vs Factual News with respect to Venue, Party &amp; Job Title Overall, through visualization, we have tried to find out the most reliable method of receiving correct information, which platforms we can pay attention to for controversial topics, and the suspicious figures we should avoid for getting the correct information.

The topic and dataset of Fake News Detection intrigued us to reveal more insights on the relationship between dependendent and independent features. The Liar dataset has 12,800 human labeled short statements in various contexts related to politics and is evaluated by politifact.com for its truthfulness. Politifact is a fact-checking organization that selects topics in the news and assigns a score for each news reports and its corresponding statement. Below are the some useful links Columbia Data Science Hackathon Page (2021) - https://cdssatcu.com/2021-data-science-hackathon Actual Dataset - https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip Dataset Evaluation by Politifact.com - https://www.politifact.com/ Below is the description of the features present in the dataset. 1) ID - Unique Row ID associated for each Statement. 2) Label - Truthfulness of statements: “True”, “False”, “Barely-True”, “Half-True”, “Mostly-True”, “Pants-Fire”. 3) Statement - Sentences of words varying between 5 to 5000. 4) Subject - The topic related to Statement (ex: healthcare, jobs, economy, etc). 5) Speaker - The person who has given the statement. 6) SpeakerJobTitle - The job title associated with the speaker (ex: president, attorney, etc). 7) StateInfo - The state where the statement was made. 8) Party Affiliated - The party the speaker belongs to (ex: republican, democrat, independent, etc). 9) Barely True Counts - The accumulation of Barely True counts associated with Speaker. 10) False Counts - The accumulation of False Counts associated with Speaker. 11) Half False Counts - The accumulation of Half False Counts associated with Speaker. 12) Mostly True Counts - The accumulation of Mostly True Counts associated with Speaker. 13) Pants Fire Counts - The accumulation of Pants Fire Counts associated with Speaker. 14) Venue/Location - The medium through which news was Spread (ex: television, radio, news press, speech, etc) "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Below Steps were used for transforming the dataset The first step in the cleaning is to concatenate the 3 files. We merged the train, test and validate files into 1 file, fakeNewsClean.csv. We did this as the task was related to exploring data through visualization, and no modeling of data was required. The three files together will help us to have a better understanding of overall data distribution. In the process of generating new file, we also replaced ID Column with a new ID column consisting of numbers from 1 to number of rows in the dataframe. We saw most of the columns in the data had 2 rows missing. Taking a closer look, the rows with ID 5872, and 8180 had most of the columns missing. So we removed those 2 rows from the dataset. For The columns Subject, SpeakerJobTitle, Speaker, Venue/Location, and “The Party Affiliation”, we choose to replace missing values with a new category “Unknown”. This will be a new category helps us to understand where data was missing and how it is related to each questions. Below is the Projection of Missing values for each column for each column in the dataset. ## Speaker Job Title State Info Venue/Location ## 3170 2446 110 ## Subject(s) Speaker The Party Affiliation ## 2 2 2 ## Barely True Counts False Counts Half True Counts ## 2 2 2 ## Mostly True Counts Pants on Fire Counts ID ## 2 2 0 ## Label Statement ## 0 0 After Cleaning ## ID Label Statement ## 0 0 0 ## Subject(s) Speaker Speaker Job Title ## 0 0 0 ## State Info The Party Affiliation Barely True Counts ## 0 0 0 ## False Counts Half True Counts Mostly True Counts ## 0 0 0 ## Pants on Fire Counts Venue/Location ## 0 0 For columns Venue, Subject and SpeakerJobTitle, StateInfo, and PartyAffiliation we followed the below steps for pre-processing For each sentence in the following column :- :- Converted each sentence to lower case :- Removed all Punctuations :- Removed extra whitespaces :- split the sentences into words by delimiter = &quot; &quot; :- Removed Stop-Words :- Concatenated the words to form the sentence For Venue, Subject and SpeakerJobTitle, we also did an extra step to group similar words together. For example, a venue like Tweet, Tweets, Tweet! were all grouped into 1 group using “group_str” function. Using all the steps we have created a new file, FakeNews_Clean.csv which we will be used for discovering insights to our questions. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Below are some key observations with respect to Missing Values in the dataset.

Most of the columns have 2 missing values, which after taking a closer look belongs to ID’s 5872 and 8180 Speaker Job Title has the most missing values - 3170 missing entries Top 30 row-id having maximum missing values ## 5872 8180 921 1137 1274 2584 2834 3622 3645 4020 5845 6058 6279 ## 11 11 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ## 6553 6603 8125 8172 8222 8952 9323 9583 9752 10096 10434 10667 10871 ## 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ## 11120 3 8 13 ## 3 2 2 2 Maximum number of columns with missing values in a given row are 11. For examples Id’s like 5872, 8180 etc. have 11 columns with missing values. Heatmap Since we noticed that “Speaker Job Title” and “State Info” had maximum missing values, we used heatmaps to see if we can observe any pattern. Below are the observed patterns :- For “Speaker Job Title”, True &amp; False Staements were completely missing. For “State Info” feature, False Statements were completely missing. Missing proportions We created this missing values plots to identify any patterns for the rows. The majority of the rows have no missing values Roughly 1800 rows have Speaker Job Title and State Info missing Over 1000 rows only have Speaker Job Title missing, and roughly 500 rows only have State Info missing. The rest of the patterns are hardly present. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results Question 1: Which positions of authority lead to Fake &amp; Factual information? Which party tends to spread Fake News more? Observation from Graph 1.1 President, Governor and Senators spread the most news in all categories of truthfulness. The “President Elect” &amp; “President Candidate” had very similar news counts throughout the truthfulness spectrum Senators from the Party lead the count for spreading information, for both Factual &amp; Fake. The graph also demonstrates highest pants-fire count for Senators, demonstrating that they spread the most ridiculous claims out of all job titles in the graph. For all job titles, the counts for mostly-true news were higher than true news. House Officials have had the least counts in spreading Fake or Factual News. The total count for pants-fire, false, barely-true, and half-true news is higher than the total count for mostly-true and true news, signifying that almost all job titles in the graph are associated with a high proportion of Fake News. Observation from Graph 1.2 The proportion of true news is higher than the proportion of false news for the Democrat and Independent parties, with the opposite case for the Republican party. This tells us that the Democrat and Independent parties are a little bit more reliable in delivery of truthful news. There is false news present for most speakers in every party, albeit at different proportions. Question 2: What are the most selected topic/Subject picked by each Speaker which has the highest tendency of Spreading Fake News\" Observation from Graph Senators have spread the most Fake News with respect to every topic present in the graph President Candidates have spread fake news only in Immigration President didn’t report Fake News related to topics in Military, Abortion, Debts, Jobs, and Economy. Only Senators and President had fake news related to topics in Fires, Iraq, Israel, Islam, Foreign Policy, Fedral Budge, and Energy. Education has the highest count for fake news. Question 3: Which states are spreading the most false news, also noting the number of different speakers involved in spreading Fake News? Observation from the Graphs Above Graph gives a clear idea for the count of Fake News in each State. The larger the rectangle, the higher the number of Fake News was spread within the associated state. The color is mapped with the different number of speakers who spread fake news in the given state. There were lot of states in the dataset which were labelled Unknown while pre-processing, which apparently are also spreading Fake News in high proportions Texas is most widely known state to spread Fake News with about 400+ different Speakers involved in spreading Fake News Count of Fake News spread is closely related with the different number of Speakers spreading the news. States with a smaller number of false counts have fewer number of speakers. New York, Wisconsin and Florida have almost equal number of counts in spreading Fake News, which are comparatively high when compare to other states. Also, Wisconsin and New York share the same count for number of speakers but the Florida has highest number of different speakers among the three. Question 4: Which method of communication has resulted in the most Fake News spread by state? Observation from Graph Below are a few venues/platforms which were used the most to spread fake news per State. Florida, Texas, California, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, and North Carolina mostly spread Fake News through Press Releases. Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia mostly spread Fake News through Speeches. Many states used a variety of venues to spread fake news, rather than just one consistent venue. Hence the gray spots in the graph. Our grouping of the Venues (such as Tweets/Tweet to Tweet) might not be completely accurate since we used group_str to do the concatenation with the distance of similarity as 3 between words. This parameter can be manipulated for better efficiency. Question 5: Correlations, Clusters &amp; Outliers observed for different Venues/Platforms in spreading Fake News for each State. Observation from the Graphs The count of Fake News spread for the venue OnlineInterview was less than 10 for all regions except Wisconsin, Texas and Florida. Most of the States, which have used Press Release for spreading Fake News, have also used News Release. We observed a positive correlation between these two venues for most States Similarly, we noticed a negative correlation between News Release and TV Advertisement. The states which have used News Release have a reduced count for TV Advertisements We noticed a wide range of differences in count between New York &amp; Jersey for each venue. Surprisingly, Twitter had relatively low frequencies for each State despite being the most popular social media platform. Question 6: Count of Words in a Statement in relation with its Label Observation from the Graphs Note: the statements shown on the graph are between 100 and 1000 words. For most speakers, there are more true than false statements given that they have less than 300 words. For statements with over 300 words, there is a higher count of true statements compared to false statements. Question 7: What are the proportions of fake news for each state? Observation from the Graphs All states generally report a variety of news ranging throughout the entire truth spectrum (from true to false). The majority of news reports have some level of truth in them, with the exception of Maine and Minnesota. All states follow roughly the same distribution of fake news (of course, with the exception of states with very few reports). Texas reported the most news while Tennessee, Montana, Rhode Island, and Mississippi have the fewest news reports out of all states. Out of all states with over 100 reports, Vermont was the only state that did not make any pants-on-fire reports (in other words, Vermont was the only state with over 100 reports that did not make any ridiculous claims). Question 8: What are the states with maximum proportions of fake news and in what subject? Observation from the Graphs Note: news reports that are labelled with pants-on-fire, false, barely-true, or half-true are considered not factual. Factual news are either mostly-true or true. The legend shows the order of truth values, which we will call the truth spectrum Alabama is the most misinformative state and Conneticut is the most informative. Healthcare is the most misinformative subject out of all subjects in the states, with candidates-biography being the second most misinformative subject. The top 5 most misinformative states are either Southern or Midwestern, while the bottom 3 most misinformative states are located in the Eastern region of the United States Apart from the top 5 and bottom 3 states, there does not seem to be a particular region associated with misinformation spread by state Question 9: Distribution of Factual News with respect to state Observation from the Graphs Note: Each label was assigned a score: 0 for “pants-on-fire”, 1 for “false”, 2 for “barely-true”, 3 for “half-true”, 4 for “mostly-true”, and 5 for “true” Most states either have a very flat, bimodal, or multimodal distribution. This indicates that most states have news reports that range through multiple points in the truth spectrum, which is consistent with the graph in question 7. The top 2 most honest states by median (Wyoming and North Dakota in this case) have most of their distribution around the score of 5. North Dakota is consistently true with their news, while Washington is consistently half-true with their news Question 10: Which subject has the most concentrated fake news? Observation from the Graphs Note: a news report is considered fake news if it is either pants-on-fire, false, barely-true, or half-true Religion has the most misinformation spread about it Most of the controversial subjects present in question 8 are also present in this graph (and are therefor the top 50 most misinformative subjects) Like one would expect, most of the subjects present in this graph are related to social issues or political topics. Question 11: Origin of Fake Vs Factual News with respect to Venue, Party &amp; Job Title Observation from the Graphs Fake news is present no matter what venue, party, or type of speaker it originates from For every type of venue, party, and job title, at least half of the news reports are not entirely true As seen in the Label column, most news reports made in this graph are not entirely true "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Overall, the visualizations demonstrate that every state, speaker, and party has its fault in regards to providing factual information. Some parties or States may have a higher proportion of true news compared to other parties or States but the fact is that misinformation is still present no matter what State, speaker, subject, or venue it originates from. Some of the causes for this issue could be due to the complexity of information available today. Some political topics can be so complex that it becomes hard to portray over a statement. For instance, most people would not understand the deep complexities of the American healthcare system. Social issues such as LGBTQ and abortion are very personal to people, which may cause the delivery of information related to these topics to be tinted with a personal lens. While this isn’t wrong (we would not want to invalidate anyone’s feelings), those who verify this kind of information may be lacking the perspectives of others and misinterpret information related to these subjects. Other topics such as religion has many meanings and portrayals, so of course some sources may misconstrue its representations. While venues such as social media and television makes the delivery of information more convenient, there are also constraints we need to consider. Unless we are producing documentaries or teaching the subject professionally, it is difficult to briefly and accurately portray the statement, especially for outlets where people would expect brevity. For example, consider speeches which often have a time constraints or the word limit of a tweet. The issue with misinformation today should be a collaborative effort to verify sources to ensure that correct information is being delivered through most if not all sources. Everyone should be taking responsibility. Improvements for this project may include using a better natural language processing algorithm.
